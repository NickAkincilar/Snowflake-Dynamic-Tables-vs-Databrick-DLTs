# Snowflake-Dynamic-Tables-vs-Databrick-DLTs
Comparative Analysis: Snowflake Dynamic Tables (DT) vs. Databricks Declarative Pipelines (Delta Live Tables, DLTs)

# Snowflake 
- Import the Snowflake notebook into new workspaces and start running each cell.
- To disable the Dynamic table refreshes, you can manually disable the refresh for 3 GOLD layer tables which trigger refreshes for the rest of the downstream tables.

# Databricks:
- Stany tunes. I am trying to find a way to package the DLT pipeline so it can be deployed from a noteboko.
